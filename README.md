# Smart DayNight Switcher

Calculates daily sunrise and sunset times for your location and automatically switches your Obsidian theme: light mode when the sun rises ‚òÄÔ∏è and dark mode when it sets üåí.

No more manual theme switching!

## How to use it?

1. Install the plugin and enable it.
2. Go to the plugin settings and enter your approximate coordinates (latitude and longitude).
3. Enjoy!

_Note: Obsidian doesn‚Äôt allow plugins to access your geolocation, so you‚Äôll need to input it manually._

---

### How to find your coordinates?

It‚Äôs simple!

1. Open [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/), [gps-coordinates.net](https://www.gps-coordinates.net/), or any similar tool.
2. Type your city name or pick a spot on the map.
3. Copy the coordinates and paste them into the plugin settings.

### Why are coordinates needed?

Sunrise and sunset times vary by location and date due to latitude, longitude, and the time of year. For example, on March 12, 2025, the sun rises at 07:05 and sets at 16:16 in Madrid, but in Warsaw (same time zone), it‚Äôs 05:22 and 17:33. Quite a difference, right? Curious why? Check [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Why+Do+Sunrise+and+Sunset+Times+Vary%3F) or this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma?utm_source=chatgpt.com) for more!

_Note: Obsidian doesn‚Äôt allow plugins to access your geolocation, that is why you need to input it manually._

### What if I don‚Äôt enter coordinates?

The plugin defaults to London‚Äôs coordinates, switching themes based on sunrise/sunset there.

### How does it use location data?

The plugin uses your latitude and longitude in a formula to calculate sunrise/sunset times locally on your device. No data is sent anywhere. Still worried? Feel free to use coordinates of a nearby city (within 200 km) instead‚Äîthough the further away, the less accurate the timing.

# Future Features

If this plugin becomes popular enough (downloaded by over 5,000 people), I‚Äôll make an effort to implement the following features:

-   Option to set an offset  
    If you‚Äôd like the dark theme to activate, for example, 10 minutes / 20 minutes and etc. before sunset or after sunset, you‚Äôll be able to specify this offset in the settings;
-   Option to switch not only the color scheme but also the theme itself (a separate theme for nighttime and one for daytime);
-   Smooth color transition  
    The background color won‚Äôt abruptly turn dark black. As the sun begins to set, the plugin will gradually darken the background‚Äîslightly at first, then progressively darker until sunset;
-   Synchronization with the ambient light sensor (if the Obsidian API supports this; I haven‚Äôt checked yet);
-   Enable dark theme when the device switches to power-saving mode.
